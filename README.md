# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and develeloped with the help of this tutorial: [React crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).

As an addition to make this my own project, I implemented a procrastination page, where you can play TicTacToe against an AI using a simple version of the minmax algorithm.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`
Runs a local db server for development

## Used Technologies:
